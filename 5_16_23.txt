SCRUM / AGILE 


- burndown chart
	- used to keep track of how many hours are left in the project
	- it is an estimation tool
	- already included in JIRA
	- can be used to show clients or other workers
	- JIRA calculates automatically for you
	- Can be used for individuals and also for teams separately 
	- not used super often because its not a close estimation

- backlog prioritization
	- two paths - what is important to us, and what is important to client?
	- what is important to us, might be something that is necessary 
	  before completing what is important to client, that they dont realize!
	
	M - must have (non negotiable, necessary for job to get done)
	S - should have (very important but not absolutely essential)
	C - could have (some fun additions and nice features)
	W - won't have (not necessary, takes too much time, dropped from priorities)
