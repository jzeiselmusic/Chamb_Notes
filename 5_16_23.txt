SCRUM / AGILE 


- burndown chart
	- used to keep track of how many hours are left in the project
	- it is an estimation tool
	- already included in JIRA
	- can be used to show clients or other workers
	- JIRA calculates automatically for you
	- Can be used for individuals and also for teams separately 
	- not used super often because its not a close estimation


- backlog prioritization
	- two paths - what is important to us, and what is important to client?
	- what is important to us, might be something that is necessary 
	  before completing what is important to client, that they dont realize!
	
	Moscow Model

	M - must have (non negotiable, necessary for job to get done)
	S - should have (very important but not absolutely essential)
	C - could have (some fun additions and nice features)
	W - won't have (not necessary, takes too much time, dropped from priorities)

	Kano Model
	- this one is about what is best for the customer, not for us

	Must-have - basic features that the customers won't even notice because they are so obviously necessary

	Performance-Attributes - features that will make the customers happy because they see we do a good job

	Delighters - features that will surprise and delight!
