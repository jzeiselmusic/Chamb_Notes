- vehicle will advertise
- hub/gdo will hear advertisement
	- supposed to be e-coded but that is too close to security 3.0
	- this has to do with the way the advertisement is laid out
- VID is sent with the connection. Hub needs to the VID to decide what GDO to operate
- UUID is passed, same on every smurf, describes what profile is being discussed
	- this can probably be random, we get to decide 
- GDO is scanning, sending connection command 
	- once connection, they exchange service discovery

- HSM Services- hardware security layer (encrypytion / decryption). HSM is 
	a module that deals with the chips security.
- AUTOSAR is an industrial defined standard. Kind of a layer on top of different 
	communication standards (SPI, UART, etc). What does it define? Do?
- AUTOSAR essentially will be sold to us as a SPI controller, UART controller, 
	encryption controller, etc. etc. 

- Unified Message Queue is the heart of the process. The smurf arbeit 
	pushes requests (actuate, close, open, etc) to the message queue
	and then the different subworkers check the queue to see if there is
	any work for them to do. This way we can add more functionality 
	and change it over time to fit whatever encryption, security, comm
	processes each OEM requires.
